Three data structures
-Identifiers
-Locations
-Events

An identifer is globally unique. It is a set of values that uniquely identify
an object.

A location is the abstract concept of place. A location could have coordinates
assigned to it or not (perhaps just label).

An event is an identifier, a location, and a timestamp.
